## Project Overview

In this project, a convolution neural network (CNN) pipeline is implemented to contruct a dog breed predictor. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

This is project from the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, and it is built based on the instructions provided by Udacity in this repository: https://github.com/udacity/dog-project


## Project Instructions

The IPython notebook in this repository is an end result of implementing the CNN according to instructor notes. To build the pipeline from the beginning, please refer to the README file in the Udacity repository provided above.


## Analysis
